<a href=https://github.com/GreyWard/jmart target="_blank">jmart</a> another repository for development stage and backend (without a proper UI).

## üì¶ How to install
1. Download all files (can ignore the git files)
2. Open the folder with Android Studio
3. Download necessary dependencies (including development stage ```jmart``` repository mentioned above)
4. Run the backend first (use your favorite Java IDE to make things easier)
5. Open the virtual device (or plug your android device), and compile the program

## üöÄ How to use
1. Try to register a new account, if it failed then probably your backend port is not the same (make sure to run it too!)
2. Login the new account, it should move to the products frame
3. Open account information to check your balance and other info, you can also create new store!
4. Use *"Coupon Code"* in the backend to fill your balance (this is for learning purposes, it **SHOULD NOT** works as easy as that)
5. Try to buy something in the product frame, you can also create new product if you registered a new store (using the (+) button above)
6. Your purchase history and shipment will be shown in the History menu (check the navbar above!)

## üìÅ Other Information for Usage
The program itself is quite self-explained since Java has **Javadocs** feature, feel free to explore the codes in backend *jmart* and the frontend *jmart-android*
